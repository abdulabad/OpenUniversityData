## R Markdown Open University Data

We start by getting the working directory, which is correct so we don't have to set an alternative.
```{r working directory}
getwd()
```
We then read the csv file and specify the number of rows we want to output - otherwise we end up with more than one thousand rows.
```{r read csv}
read.csv("studentAssessment.csv", nrows = 5)
```
Then we assign the csv file to a variable for ease of manipulation.
```{r assign variable}
dat <-read.csv("studentAssessment.csv")
```
```{r count fields}
length(dat$id_student)
```
Above we use length to count the number of fields in the id_student column, using the $ operator to specify the column within the whole data frame assigned to "dat."

Below we use mean and specify na.rm = TRUE, so it won't output NA as the mean. 
```{r mean}
mean(dat$score, na.rm = TRUE)
```
